       <h5>Dear friend,</h5>
        <p>
I need to tell you a situation that is fairly annoying.
<br>
Do you know those moments where we hear an advice, a phrase, and no matter how much truth there is in it, no matter how correct it is, we end up ignoring its teachings and go on living normally. Well, ye.
We spend our whole lives hearing that something is bad and needs to be avoided, our parents say it, our spiritual guru, our sacred books, and being the good humans we are, we ignore it.
So out of nowhere that same advice is said, sometimes with the same words, but this time something clicks inside of us and that knowledge is absorbed as if we were hearing it for the first time.
What a stupid attitude! This random click between word and man is, truthfully, irritating.
What was new that made us change this time? Nothing, there is nothing!
Picture this, my friend, picture how much easier it would be if we could assimilate certain truths from the very first moment we hear them.
I would have never lost a single day of my life!
<br>
We could even, for the babies still in the womb, instead of Bach and Beethoven, give life advice for them to listen! 
And then we would be born ready to overcome the hardships of this life, maybe we wouldn't even have them!
I am sorry for the delay, the fact is that a few days ago, on a seminar, a famous of Hollywood said we should 'cut the excess'.
That was probably what clicked with me, 'cut the excess'
I have listened to similar advice in dozens of other places, sometimes as 'have focus', sometimes 'focus on what is important', or maybe 'everything in excess is bad',
or like on the most important book of all, 'if you find honey, eat enough to satisfy, so you do not fill yourself and throw it up'.
But out of all of those, 'cut the excess' was what clicked with me.
Did I already not know that when you cut the excess in a text, all that remains is what is really necessary? As they say, to write well (sometimes) is to speak 
more with as few words as possible.
<br>
And find that that does not limit itself to writing. The laws of life, opposed to laws and physics theories, does not limit itself to the field of applicability.
Our journey in this world become harder depending on the weight we carry with us. Choices are heavy. And many choices are heavier.
A person that does not dedicate himself at nothing, that does not put his heart on what he does, but on the contrary, does everything at the same time, 
wants to be everything at once, ends up being nothing.
<br>
When one have many roads to walk or when one does nnot move, or worse, when one loses himself.
Its like an alpinist that takes everything he sees on the way. Before he reaches the top, if he ever sees it, he will he exhausted and encumbered. 
The one that, opposite to the first, knows exactly what to carry from the very first moments, will only collect during his ascend, that what he is missing
and what is necessary and that way the top is not only possible, but also easier to accomplish. sometimes we have the wrong understanding that that extra weight we carry
is what keeps us warm, protects us, that it will make us have a destiny different from the others, and up to an extent its true, but throughout the journey 
this weight will do nothing aside from taking our energy and capacity
We will die like most, at the bottom of the mountain, buried deep in useless things that we thought were essential. To find out who we really are for example, not much is necessary, on the contrary, very little is needed. The fewer the better.
The essence of who we really are, of what we really want to do and be, follows us throughout our whole existence even if surrounded by excesses that we insist in carrying.
For that reason, my old friend, I decided to get rid of (almost everything) that I see as excess and that has been on my way to the top of this mountain called writing.
Its necessary in these moments of decision, to be coherent, if I get rid of everything at once, ten-time more are the chances I will fail.
In this climbing the difficulty of terrain, atmosphere and clime are enough, I will not subject myself to the dangers I can choose to suffer.
You do not need to wait for my next letter to know if I am right or not, my agreement and my words have as witness humanity and its best.
Regarding you, I advise you do the same, all of those problems that you keep telling me about and in which you have never got rid of completely, surely will cease to exist 
if we follow this road together.
Cut the excess!
        </p>
